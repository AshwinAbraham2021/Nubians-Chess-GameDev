movement/capture mechanism
turns-> maybe rotate the board each turn??
when a piece is selected show the possible squares
detect checkmate? allow only legal moves, detect stalemate by no possible legal moves?
regular chessboard atleast:
	pawn promotion mechanism
	en passant?

we can have a main screen with different modes of chess as options, then load the relevant board accordingly
