Chess

We have implemented three variations of chess- 
    the standard variant,  
    Fischer Random Chess aka Chess 960  , and
    Glinski's variant (on a Hexagonal Board)

To start, you may open Main.html & choose your preferred variant,
Or directly go to Chessboard_main.html, Random.html or Chessboard_Hex.html for the above three variants respectively.

All the rules are the same as the respective official rules. 
We have implemented castling, promotion, en passant ,checks and only allowing legal moves wherever applicable
On the standard variant and fischer variant, open the console to see the moves in algebraic chess notation!
